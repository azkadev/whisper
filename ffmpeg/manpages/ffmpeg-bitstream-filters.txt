NAME
       ffmpeg-bitstream-filters - FFmpeg bitstream filters

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes the bitstream filters provided by the
       libavcodec library.

       A bitstream filter operates on the encoded stream data, and performs
       bitstream level modifications without performing decoding.

BITSTREAM FILTERS
       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported bitstream
       filters are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using
       the configure option "--list-bsfs".

       You can disable all the bitstream filters using the configure option
       "--disable-bsfs", and selectively enable any bitstream filter using the
       option "--enable-bsf=BSF", or you can disable a particular bitstream
       filter using the option "--disable-bsf=BSF".

       The option "-bsfs" of the ff* tools will display the list of all the
       supported bitstream filters included in your build.

       The ff* tools have a -bsf option applied per stream, taking a comma-
       separated list of filters, whose parameters follow the filter name
       after a '='.

	       ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v copy -bsf:v filter1[=opt1=str1:opt2=str2][,filter2] OUTPUT

       Below is a description of the currently available bitstream filters,
       with their parameters, if any.

   aac_adtstoasc
       Convert MPEG-2/4 AAC ADTS to an MPEG-4 Audio Specific Configuration
       bitstream.

       This filter creates an MPEG-4 AudioSpecificConfig from an MPEG-2/4 ADTS
       header and removes the ADTS header.

       This filter is required for example when copying an AAC stream from a
       raw ADTS AAC or an MPEG-TS container to MP4A-LATM, to an FLV file, or
       to MOV/MP4 files and related formats such as 3GP or M4A. Please note
       that it is auto-inserted for MP4A-LATM and MOV/MP4 and related formats.

   av1_metadata
       Modify metadata embedded in an AV1 stream.

       td  Insert or remove temporal delimiter OBUs in all temporal units of
	   the stream.

	   insert
	       Insert a TD at the beginning of every TU which does not already
	       have one.

	   remove
	       Remove the TD from the beginning of every TU which has one.

       color_primaries
       transfer_characteristics
       matrix_coefficients
	   Set the color description fields in the stream (see AV1 section
	   6.4.2).

       color_range
	   Set the color range in the stream (see AV1 section 6.4.2; note that
	   this cannot be set for streams using BT.709 primaries, sRGB
	   transfer characteristic and identity (RGB) matrix coefficients).

	   tv  Limited range.

	   pc  Full range.

       chroma_sample_position
	   Set the chroma sample location in the stream (see AV1 section
	   6.4.2).  This can only be set for 4:2:0 streams.

	   vertical
	       Left position (matching the default in MPEG-2 and H.264).

	   colocated
	       Top-left position.

       tick_rate
	   Set the tick rate (time_scale / num_units_in_display_tick) in the
	   timing info in the sequence header.

       num_ticks_per_picture
	   Set the number of ticks in each picture, to indicate that the
	   stream has a fixed framerate.  Ignored if tick_rate is not also
	   set.

       delete_padding
	   Deletes Padding OBUs.

   chomp
       Remove zero padding at the end of a packet.

   dca_core
       Extract the core from a DCA/DTS stream, dropping extensions such as
       DTS-HD.

   dump_extra
       Add extradata to the beginning of the filtered packets except when said
       packets already exactly begin with the extradata that is intended to be
       added.

       freq
	   The additional argument specifies which packets should be filtered.
	   It accepts the values:

	   k
	   keyframe
	       add extradata to all key packets

	   e
	   all add extradata to all packets

       If not specified it is assumed k.

       For example the following ffmpeg command forces a global header (thus
       disabling individual packet headers) in the H.264 packets generated by
       the "libx264" encoder, but corrects them by adding the header stored in
       extradata to the key packets:

	       ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 -flags:v +global_header -c:v libx264 -bsf:v dump_extra out.ts

   dv_error_marker
       Blocks in DV which are marked as damaged are replaced by blocks of the
       specified color.

       color
	   The color to replace damaged blocks by

       sta A 16 bit mask which specifies which of the 16 possible error status
	   values are to be replaced by colored blocks. 0xFFFE is the default
	   which replaces all non 0 error status values.

	   ok  No error, no concealment

	   err Error, No concealment

	   res Reserved

	   notok
	       Error or concealment

	   notres
	       Not reserved

	   Aa, Ba, Ca, Ab, Bb, Cb, A, B, C, a, b, erri, erru
	       The specific error status code

	   see page 44-46 or section 5.5 of
	   <http://web.archive.org/web/20060927044735/http://www.smpte.org/smpte_store/standards/pdf/s314m.pdf>

   eac3_core
       Extract the core from a E-AC-3 stream, dropping extra channels.

   extract_extradata
       Extract the in-band extradata.

       Certain codecs allow the long-term headers (e.g. MPEG-2 sequence
       headers, or H.264/HEVC (VPS/)SPS/PPS) to be transmitted either "in-
       band" (i.e. as a part of the bitstream containing the coded frames) or
       "out of band" (e.g. on the container level). This latter form is called
       "extradata" in FFmpeg terminology.

       This bitstream filter detects the in-band headers and makes them
       available as extradata.

       remove
	   When this option is enabled, the long-term headers are removed from
	   the bitstream after extraction.

   filter_units
       Remove units with types in or not in a given set from the stream.

       pass_types
	   List of unit types or ranges of unit types to pass through while
	   removing all others.  This is specified as a '|'-separated list of
	   unit type values or ranges of values with '-'.

       remove_types
	   Identical to pass_types, except the units in the given set removed
	   and all others passed through.

       Extradata is unchanged by this transformation, but note that if the
       stream contains inline parameter sets then the output may be unusable
       if they are removed.

       For example, to remove all non-VCL NAL units from an H.264 stream:

	       ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v copy -bsf:v 'filter_units=pass_types=1-5' OUTPUT

       To remove all AUDs, SEI and filler from an H.265 stream:

	       ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v copy -bsf:v 'filter_units=remove_types=35|38-40' OUTPUT

   hapqa_extract
       Extract Rgb or Alpha part of an HAPQA file, without recompression, in
       order to create an HAPQ or an HAPAlphaOnly file.

       texture
	   Specifies the texture to keep.

	   color
	   alpha

       Convert HAPQA to HAPQ

	       ffmpeg -i hapqa_inputfile.mov -c copy -bsf:v hapqa_extract=texture=color -tag:v HapY -metadata:s:v:0 encoder="HAPQ" hapq_file.mov

       Convert HAPQA to HAPAlphaOnly

	       ffmpeg -i hapqa_inputfile.mov -c copy -bsf:v hapqa_extract=texture=alpha -tag:v HapA -metadata:s:v:0 encoder="HAPAlpha Only" hapalphaonly_file.mov

   h264_metadata
       Modify metadata embedded in an H.264 stream.

       aud Insert or remove AUD NAL units in all access units of the stream.

	   pass
	   insert
	   remove

	   Default is pass.

       sample_aspect_ratio
	   Set the sample aspect ratio of the stream in the VUI parameters.
	   See H.264 table E-1.

       overscan_appropriate_flag
	   Set whether the stream is suitable for display using overscan or
	   not (see H.264 section E.2.1).

       video_format
       video_full_range_flag
	   Set the video format in the stream (see H.264 section E.2.1 and
	   table E-2).

       colour_primaries
       transfer_characteristics
       matrix_coefficients
	   Set the colour description in the stream (see H.264 section E.2.1
	   and tables E-3, E-4 and E-5).

       chroma_sample_loc_type
	   Set the chroma sample location in the stream (see H.264 section
	   E.2.1 and figure E-1).

       tick_rate
	   Set the tick rate (time_scale / num_units_in_tick) in the VUI
	   parameters.	This is the smallest time unit representable in the
	   stream, and in many cases represents the field rate of the stream
	   (double the frame rate).

       fixed_frame_rate_flag
	   Set whether the stream has fixed framerate - typically this
	   indicates that the framerate is exactly half the tick rate, but the
	   exact meaning is dependent on interlacing and the picture structure
	   (see H.264 section E.2.1 and table E-6).

       zero_new_constraint_set_flags
	   Zero constraint_set4_flag and constraint_set5_flag in the SPS.
	   These bits were reserved in a previous version of the H.264 spec,
	   and thus some hardware decoders require these to be zero. The
	   result of zeroing this is still a valid bitstream.

       crop_left
       crop_right
       crop_top
       crop_bottom
	   Set the frame cropping offsets in the SPS.  These values will
	   replace the current ones if the stream is already cropped.

	   These fields are set in pixels.  Note that some sizes may not be
	   representable if the chroma is subsampled or the stream is
	   interlaced (see H.264 section 7.4.2.1.1).

       sei_user_data
	   Insert a string as SEI unregistered user data.  The argument must
	   be of the form UUID+string, where the UUID is as hex digits
	   possibly separated by hyphens, and the string can be anything.

	   For example, 086f3693-b7b3-4f2c-9653-21492feee5b8+hello will insert
	   the string ``hello'' associated with the given UUID.

       delete_filler
	   Deletes both filler NAL units and filler SEI messages.

       display_orientation
	   Insert, extract or remove Display orientation SEI messages.	See
	   H.264 section D.1.27 and D.2.27 for syntax and semantics.

	   pass
	   insert
	   remove
	   extract

	   Default is pass.

	   Insert mode works in conjunction with "rotate" and "flip" options.
	   Any pre-existing Display orientation messages will be removed in
	   insert or remove mode.  Extract mode attaches the display matrix to
	   the packet as side data.

       rotate
	   Set rotation in display orientation SEI (anticlockwise angle in
	   degrees).  Range is -360 to +360. Default is NaN.

       flip
	   Set flip in display orientation SEI.

	   horizontal
	   vertical

	   Default is unset.

       level
	   Set the level in the SPS.  Refer to H.264 section A.3 and tables
	   A-1 to A-5.

	   The argument must be the name of a level (for example, 4.2), a
	   level_idc value (for example, 42), or the special name auto
	   indicating that the filter should attempt to guess the level from
	   the input stream properties.

   h264_mp4toannexb
       Convert an H.264 bitstream from length prefixed mode to start code
       prefixed mode (as defined in the Annex B of the ITU-T H.264
       specification).

       This is required by some streaming formats, typically the MPEG-2
       transport stream format (muxer "mpegts").

       For example to remux an MP4 file containing an H.264 stream to mpegts
       format with ffmpeg, you can use the command:

	       ffmpeg -i INPUT.mp4 -codec copy -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb OUTPUT.ts

       Please note that this filter is auto-inserted for MPEG-TS (muxer
       "mpegts") and raw H.264 (muxer "h264") output formats.

   h264_redundant_pps
       This applies a specific fixup to some Blu-ray streams which contain
       redundant PPSs modifying irrelevant parameters of the stream which
       confuse other transformations which require correct extradata.

       A new single global PPS is created, and all of the redundant PPSs
       within the stream are removed.

   hevc_metadata
       Modify metadata embedded in an HEVC stream.

       aud Insert or remove AUD NAL units in all access units of the stream.

	   insert
	   remove
       sample_aspect_ratio
	   Set the sample aspect ratio in the stream in the VUI parameters.

       video_format
       video_full_range_flag
	   Set the video format in the stream (see H.265 section E.3.1 and
	   table E.2).

       colour_primaries
       transfer_characteristics
       matrix_coefficients
	   Set the colour description in the stream (see H.265 section E.3.1
	   and tables E.3, E.4 and E.5).

       chroma_sample_loc_type
	   Set the chroma sample location in the stream (see H.265 section
	   E.3.1 and figure E.1).

       tick_rate
	   Set the tick rate in the VPS and VUI parameters (time_scale /
	   num_units_in_tick). Combined with num_ticks_poc_diff_one, this can
	   set a constant framerate in the stream.  Note that it is likely to
	   be overridden by container parameters when the stream is in a
	   container.

       num_ticks_poc_diff_one
	   Set poc_proportional_to_timing_flag in VPS and VUI and use this
	   value to set num_ticks_poc_diff_one_minus1 (see H.265 sections
	   7.4.3.1 and E.3.1).	Ignored if tick_rate is not also set.

       crop_left
       crop_right
       crop_top
       crop_bottom
	   Set the conformance window cropping offsets in the SPS.  These
	   values will replace the current ones if the stream is already
	   cropped.

	   These fields are set in pixels.  Note that some sizes may not be
	   representable if the chroma is subsampled (H.265 section
	   7.4.3.2.1).

       level
	   Set the level in the VPS and SPS.  See H.265 section A.4 and tables
	   A.6 and A.7.

	   The argument must be the name of a level (for example, 5.1), a
	   general_level_idc value (for example, 153 for level 5.1), or the
	   special name auto indicating that the filter should attempt to
	   guess the level from the input stream properties.

   hevc_mp4toannexb
       Convert an HEVC/H.265 bitstream from length prefixed mode to start code
       prefixed mode (as defined in the Annex B of the ITU-T H.265
       specification).

       This is required by some streaming formats, typically the MPEG-2
       transport stream format (muxer "mpegts").

       For example to remux an MP4 file containing an HEVC stream to mpegts
       format with ffmpeg, you can use the command:

	       ffmpeg -i INPUT.mp4 -codec copy -bsf:v hevc_mp4toannexb OUTPUT.ts

       Please note that this filter is auto-inserted for MPEG-TS (muxer
       "mpegts") and raw HEVC/H.265 (muxer "h265" or "hevc") output formats.

   imxdump
       Modifies the bitstream to fit in MOV and to be usable by the Final Cut
       Pro decoder. This filter only applies to the mpeg2video codec, and is
       likely not needed for Final Cut Pro 7 and newer with the appropriate
       -tag:v.

       For example, to remux 30 MB/sec NTSC IMX to MOV:

	       ffmpeg -i input.mxf -c copy -bsf:v imxdump -tag:v mx3n output.mov

   mjpeg2jpeg
       Convert MJPEG/AVI1 packets to full JPEG/JFIF packets.

       MJPEG is a video codec wherein each video frame is essentially a JPEG
       image. The individual frames can be extracted without loss, e.g. by

	       ffmpeg -i ../some_mjpeg.avi -c:v copy frames_%d.jpg

       Unfortunately, these chunks are incomplete JPEG images, because they
       lack the DHT segment required for decoding. Quoting from
       <http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000063.shtml>:

       Avery Lee, writing in the rec.video.desktop newsgroup in 2001,
       commented that "MJPEG, or at least the MJPEG in AVIs having the MJPG
       fourcc, is restricted JPEG with a fixed -- and *omitted* -- Huffman
       table. The JPEG must be YCbCr colorspace, it must be 4:2:2, and it must
       use basic Huffman encoding, not arithmetic or progressive. . . . You
       can indeed extract the MJPEG frames and decode them with a regular JPEG
       decoder, but you have to prepend the DHT segment to them, or else the
       decoder won't have any idea how to decompress the data. The exact table
       necessary is given in the OpenDML spec."

       This bitstream filter patches the header of frames extracted from an
       MJPEG stream (carrying the AVI1 header ID and lacking a DHT segment) to
       produce fully qualified JPEG images.

	       ffmpeg -i mjpeg-movie.avi -c:v copy -bsf:v mjpeg2jpeg frame_%d.jpg
	       exiftran -i -9 frame*.jpg
	       ffmpeg -i frame_%d.jpg -c:v copy rotated.avi

   mjpegadump
       Add an MJPEG A header to the bitstream, to enable decoding by
       Quicktime.

   mov2textsub
       Extract a representable text file from MOV subtitles, stripping the
       metadata header from each subtitle packet.

       See also the text2movsub filter.

   mp3decomp
       Decompress non-standard compressed MP3 audio headers.

   mpeg2_metadata
       Modify metadata embedded in an MPEG-2 stream.

       display_aspect_ratio
	   Set the display aspect ratio in the stream.

	   The following fixed values are supported:

	   4/3
	   16/9
	   221/100

	   Any other value will result in square pixels being signalled
	   instead (see H.262 section 6.3.3 and table 6-3).

       frame_rate
	   Set the frame rate in the stream.  This is constructed from a table
	   of known values combined with a small multiplier and divisor - if
	   the supplied value is not exactly representable, the nearest
	   representable value will be used instead (see H.262 section 6.3.3
	   and table 6-4).

       video_format
	   Set the video format in the stream (see H.262 section 6.3.6 and
	   table 6-6).

       colour_primaries
       transfer_characteristics
       matrix_coefficients
	   Set the colour description in the stream (see H.262 section 6.3.6
	   and tables 6-7, 6-8 and 6-9).

   mpeg4_unpack_bframes
       Unpack DivX-style packed B-frames.

       DivX-style packed B-frames are not valid MPEG-4 and were only a
       workaround for the broken Video for Windows subsystem.  They use more
       space, can cause minor AV sync issues, require more CPU power to decode
       (unless the player has some decoded picture queue to compensate the
       2,0,2,0 frame per packet style) and cause trouble if copied into a
       standard container like mp4 or mpeg-ps/ts, because MPEG-4 decoders may
       not be able to decode them, since they are not valid MPEG-4.

       For example to fix an AVI file containing an MPEG-4 stream with DivX-
       style packed B-frames using ffmpeg, you can use the command:

	       ffmpeg -i INPUT.avi -codec copy -bsf:v mpeg4_unpack_bframes OUTPUT.avi

   noise
       Damages the contents of packets or simply drops them without damaging
       the container. Can be used for fuzzing or testing error
       resilience/concealment.

       Parameters:

       amount
	   Accepts an expression whose evaluation per-packet determines how
	   often bytes in that packet will be modified. A value below 0 will
	   result in a variable frequency.  Default is 0 which results in no
	   modification. However, if neither amount nor drop is specified,
	   amount will be set to -1. See below for accepted variables.

       drop
	   Accepts an expression evaluated per-packet whose value determines
	   whether that packet is dropped.  Evaluation to a positive value
	   results in the packet being dropped. Evaluation to a negative value
	   results in a variable chance of it being dropped, roughly inverse
	   in proportion to the magnitude of the value. Default is 0 which
	   results in no drops. See below for accepted variables.

       dropamount
	   Accepts a non-negative integer, which assigns a variable chance of
	   it being dropped, roughly inverse in proportion to the value.
	   Default is 0 which results in no drops. This option is kept for
	   backwards compatibility and is equivalent to setting drop to a
	   negative value with the same magnitude i.e. "dropamount=4" is the
	   same as "drop=-4". Ignored if drop is also specified.

       Both "amount" and "drop" accept expressions containing the following
       variables:

       n   The index of the packet, starting from zero.

       tb  The timebase for packet timestamps.

       pts Packet presentation timestamp.

       dts Packet decoding timestamp.

       nopts
	   Constant representing AV_NOPTS_VALUE.

       startpts
	   First non-AV_NOPTS_VALUE PTS seen in the stream.

       startdts
	   First non-AV_NOPTS_VALUE DTS seen in the stream.

       duration
       d   Packet duration, in timebase units.

       pos Packet position in input; may be -1 when unknown or not set.

       size
	   Packet size, in bytes.

       key Whether packet is marked as a keyframe.

       state
	   A pseudo random integer, primarily derived from the content of
	   packet payload.

       Examples

       Apply modification to every byte but don't drop any packets.

	       ffmpeg -i INPUT -c copy -bsf noise=1 output.mkv

       Drop every video packet not marked as a keyframe after timestamp 30s
       but do not modify any of the remaining packets.

	       ffmpeg -i INPUT -c copy -bsf:v noise=drop='gt(t\,30)*not(key)' output.mkv

       Drop one second of audio every 10 seconds and add some random noise to
       the rest.

	       ffmpeg -i INPUT -c copy -bsf:a noise=amount=-1:drop='between(mod(t\,10)\,9\,10)' output.mkv

   null
       This bitstream filter passes the packets through unchanged.

   pcm_rechunk
       Repacketize PCM audio to a fixed number of samples per packet or a
       fixed packet rate per second. This is similar to the asetnsamples audio
       filter but works on audio packets instead of audio frames.

       nb_out_samples, n
	   Set the number of samples per each output audio packet. The number
	   is intended as the number of samples per each channel. Default
	   value is 1024.

       pad, p
	   If set to 1, the filter will pad the last audio packet with
	   silence, so that it will contain the same number of samples (or
	   roughly the same number of samples, see frame_rate) as the previous
	   ones. Default value is 1.

       frame_rate, r
	   This option makes the filter output a fixed number of packets per
	   second instead of a fixed number of samples per packet. If the
	   audio sample rate is not divisible by the frame rate then the
	   number of samples will not be constant but will vary slightly so
	   that each packet will start as close to the frame boundary as
	   possible. Using this option has precedence over nb_out_samples.

       You can generate the well known 1602-1601-1602-1601-1602 pattern of
       48kHz audio for NTSC frame rate using the frame_rate option.

	   Set output time base.

       The expressions are evaluated through the eval API and can contain the
       following constants:

       N   The count of the input packet. Starting from 0.
